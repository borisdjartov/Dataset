This is the dataset corrresponding to the paper A Learning Classifier System Approach to Time-Critical Decision-Making in Dynamic Alternate Airport Selection. The dataset is already normalized from 0 to 1.
The dataset consists of the scneario mentioned in the paper where each scenario is an nxm matrix (numpy array). The order of the attributes within this matrix is as follows:
maximal runway distnce available [m], crosswind speed at location [kn], tailwind speed at location [kn], fuel needed [kg], status of the runway [0-6], Distance from current aircraft position to planned desti-
nation [nm], Distance from current aircraft position to appropriate alternate airport [nm]
